#Color Notes
##Overview

This is a simple web-based note-taking application that allows users to create, search, edit, and delete notes. The application supports multiple themes, enabling users to customize the appearance of the app. It also features a search function with highlighted search terms to easily find relevant notes. Notes are automatically sorted by the most recent. 
Currently, all notes are stored locally in your browser. User registration and cloud storage will be added soon.
